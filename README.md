genericdao-gradle-buildable
===========================

Gradle-buildable version of "Don't repeat the DAO!" article sample code.  
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-genericdao/

You could soon confirm how the typesafe dao is working just typing "gradle build" with Java/Gradle installed environment. It builds sample Java code, and invokes test code executing them.

(And give thanks to Per Mellqvist, who approved of making this version public ;)

Please enjoy!
